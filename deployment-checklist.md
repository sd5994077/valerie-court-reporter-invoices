- [ ] Responsive design works on all screen sizes

## Deployment Strategies

### ðŸ”„ **Option 1: Blue-Green (Safest)**
```bash
# 1. Deploy to staging/preview
git push origin feature-branch

# 2. Test preview environment thoroughly
# URL: https://your-app-git-feature-branch-user.vercel.app

# 3. After validation, merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
git push origin main

# 4. Monitor production for 15 minutes
# 5. Keep previous version tagged for rollback
```

### ðŸ”„ **Option 2: Feature Flags (Gradual)**
```bash
# 1. Deploy with features disabled
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENHANCED_VALIDATION=false

# 2. Monitor base functionality
# 3. Gradually enable features
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENHANCED_VALIDATION=true

# 4. Monitor each feature activation
```

### ðŸ”„ **Option 3: Maintenance Window (Safest for Critical Changes)**
```bash
# 1. Schedule 15-minute maintenance window
# 2. Deploy during low-traffic period
# 3. Test immediately after deployment
# 4. Monitor for 30 minutes post-deployment
```

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### âœ… **Immediate Checks (0-5 minutes)**
- [ ] Homepage loads successfully
- [ ] New invoice form opens
- [ ] Can add line items
- [ ] Validation messages appear correctly
- [ ] PDF generation works
- [ ] Database queries respond

### âœ… **Short-term Monitoring (5-30 minutes)**
- [ ] No error logs in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Response times normal
- [ ] User sessions stable
- [ ] No database connection issues

### âœ… **Extended Monitoring (30 minutes - 24 hours)**
- [ ] Invoice creation success rate normal
- [ ] PDF generation success rate normal
- [ ] No user-reported issues
- [ ] Performance metrics stable

## Rollback Plan

### ðŸš¨ **Emergency Rollback (< 2 minutes)**
```bash
# If using Vercel
vercel rollback [deployment-url]

# Or revert git commit
git revert [commit-hash]
git push origin main
```

### ðŸš¨ **Rollback Triggers**
- Error rate > 5%
- Page load time > 10 seconds
- PDF generation failing > 10%
- Database connection failures
- User cannot create invoices

## Communication Plan

### ðŸ“¢ **Stakeholder Notifications**
- [ ] Pre-deployment: Notify 24 hours in advance
- [ ] During deployment: Status updates every 5 minutes
- [ ] Post-deployment: Success confirmation within 30 minutes
- [ ] If issues: Immediate notification with ETA for resolution

### ðŸ“¢ **User Communication**
- [ ] In-app notification if maintenance required
- [ ] Clear messaging about new features
- [ ] Support contact information readily available
