    <img 
      src="/your-logo.png" 
      alt="Your Business Name"
      className={className}
    />
  );
};
```

### Option B: Use Text-Based Logo
Keep the SVG but customize the text and colors:

```typescript
// In branding.ts
styling: {
  primaryColor: "#your-color", // Change the color
  logoText: "YBS" // Your business initials
}
```
